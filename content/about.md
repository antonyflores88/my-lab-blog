Hey there ðŸ‘‹ I'm **Antony**, an IT professional from **El Salvador** passionate about learning and mastering **cloud engineering** and **DevOps practices**.  

My background started in technical support and Microsoft 365 administration, where I discovered how much I enjoy solving problems, building things, and understanding how cloud systems actually work behind the scenes.  

Now Iâ€™m focused on **learning by doing** â€” building my own labs, experimenting with tools like **Azure**, **Terraform**, and **PowerShell**, and documenting what I learn along the way.  

This site is my space to share that journey â€” the wins, the mistakes, and the progress. My goal is simple: to keep growing until I become a confident cloud engineer capable of automating, securing, and managing scalable environments.  

If youâ€™re someone who loves learning, breaking things, and fixing them again â€” welcome. Weâ€™re probably on the same path.
