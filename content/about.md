Hi, I'm **Tony** — exploring the world of **Cloud Engineering** and **DevOps** through hands-on projects.  
This site is where I document my learning path, experiments, and lessons from both **local server labs** and **Azure** environments.

I'm currently building experience with:
- Terraform automation  
- Docker containers  
- CI/CD pipelines  
- Microsoft 365 and Azure administration  

Here I share everything I learn — the wins, the failures, and the “aha” moments.
