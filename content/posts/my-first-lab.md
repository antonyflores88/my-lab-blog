Every great journey begins with curiosity and mine starts here.

I’m building a local lab environment using **Terraform**, **Docker**, and **PowerShell** to simulate real cloud setups, all this on an old 2012 Mac running a headless Ubuntu server.  
From there, I test deployments on **Azure**, automate configurations, and learn how modern DevOps pipelines fit together.

If you’re exploring the same path, welcome aboard! Let’s learn and break things together.
