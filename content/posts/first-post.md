Hello world! 👋  

In this initial blog entry, I’ll be documenting the journey of creating a **home lab** from scratch on bare metal.  
The goal is to practice cloud and DevOps workflows using real infrastructure and automation tools.

This blog will serve as a personal knowledge base, a way to share insights, and a log of the steps I take — including the mistakes, fixes, and lessons learned along the way.

### 🧠 What I’ll Be Working With

Here’s a quick overview of the main components that power this lab:

- **Git & GitHub** – version control for all configurations and Terraform projects  
- **WSL2 on Windows** – local Linux environment to write, test, and run Terraform scripts  
- **Terraform** – provisioning cloud and on-prem resources as Infrastructure-as-Code  
- **Docker** – containerizing services and apps in isolated environments  
- **Old Mac Mini (Headless Server)** – acting as a local compute node for Terraform deployments  
- **VS Code** – the main editor for scripts, configs, and GitHub commits  
- **Linux / Networking Fundamentals** – connecting and managing everything cleanly

### ⚙️ What’s Coming Next

The next entries will walk through:
1. Setting up the headless Mac as a mini server  
2. Running Terraform and Docker from WSL2  
3. Hosting small containerized apps  
4. Using GitHub for CI/CD practice  

Stay tuned — this will evolve into a complete local–cloud hybrid lab setup.
